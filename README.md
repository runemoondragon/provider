# MOON DRAGON: A Decentralized Platform

This is an open-source decentralized platform built on Rune, Bitcoin, Lightning Network, and AI. The project uses Next.js, bootstrapped with create-next-app, and serves as a proof-of-concept for exploring decentralized technologies and governance-driven innovation.

Access to the platform is exclusive to holders of a specified amount of Rune Moon Dragon tokens, fostering a unique and engaged community. Contributors and holders can collaborate to shape the platform's direction.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runemoondragon/moondragon.git
cd moondragon
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the platform in action.

## Editing the Project
